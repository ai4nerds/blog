    "## What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a framework that enhances Large Language Models (LLMs) by combining them with a retrieval system to access external knowledge during text generation.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Core Components\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Retriever\n",
    "- **Vector Database**: Stores embeddings of documents/knowledge\n",
    "- **Embedding Model**: Converts text into vector representations\n",
    "- **Similarity Search**: Finds relevant documents based on query similarity\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Generator\n",
    "- **Language Model**: Processes retrieved information and generates responses\n",
    "- **Context Window**: Manages how much retrieved content can be used\n",
    "- **Prompt Engineering**: Structures how retrieved content is presented to the LLM\n",
    "\n",
    "## How RAG Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Processing**\n",
    "   - Documents are split into chunks\n",
    "   - Each chunk is converted into embeddings\n",
    "   - Embeddings are stored in a vector database\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Query Processing**\n",
    "   - User query is received\n",
    "   - Query is converted to embedding\n",
    "   - Similar documents are retrieved\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Generation**\n",
    "   - Retrieved documents are combined with the query\n",
    "   - LLM generates response using both query and retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "## Benefits of RAG\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Up-to-date Information**: Can access current information not in LLM training\n",
    "- **Verifiable Outputs**: Responses can be traced to source documents\n",
    "- **Reduced Hallucination**: LLM is grounded in retrieved facts\n",
    "- **Domain Adaptation**: Easy to adapt to specific domains\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Challenges\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Retrieval Quality**\n",
    "   - Ensuring relevant document retrieval\n",
    "   - Handling semantic similarity effectively\n",
    "   - Managing context length\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Integration Complexity**\n",
    "   - Balancing retrieval and generation\n",
    "   - Optimizing response time\n",
    "   - Managing system resources\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Data Management**\n",
    "   - Keeping information current\n",
    "   - Handling document updates\n",
    "   - Maintaining data quality\n",
    "\n",
    "## Best Practices\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Document Processing**\n",
    "   - Use appropriate chunk sizes\n",
    "   - Maintain document context\n",
    "   - Implement effective cleaning strategies\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Retrieval Strategy**\n",
    "   - Optimize number of retrieved documents\n",
    "   - Implement re-ranking when needed\n",
    "   - Use hybrid search approaches\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **System Design**\n",
    "   - Implement caching mechanisms\n",
    "   - Monitor system performance\n",
    "   - Regular evaluation and tuning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Use Cases\n",
