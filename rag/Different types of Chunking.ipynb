    "Chunking is a foundational aspect of RAG systems that directly impacts their effectiveness and outreach. From simple fixed-size splits to advanced recursive and hybrid methods, each technique offers unique advantages. By experimenting with these strategies and optimizing based on your use case, you can build a RAG system that delivers precise, efficient, and engaging results. The Python snippets provided here serve as a practical starting point—adapt them, test them, and scale them to suit your needs.\n",
